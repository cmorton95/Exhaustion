# Exhaustion
A highly configurable plugin for Valheim intending to make stamina management more engaging, among various other changes to make gameplay more interesting. 

The plugin comes pre-configured with settings that make gameplay more interesting without harming the vanilla difficulty. 

## Features
* Modify base values such as Health, Stamina (inc. Regen/Delay, and Jump and Dodge costs), and Carry weight
* Configuration of food health, stamina and burn times
* Allow for negative stamina values similarly to Dark Souls games to make running out of stamina more punishing thereby incurring longer regen delays
* Allow sprinting into negative stamina values with the risk of becoming Exhausted(tm) if done for too long
* Alternative Encumberance system allowing you to exceed carry weight at the cost of movement speed up to a configurable threshold
* Customisation of Parry timing to allow for more or less time to parry (parry time is halved by default)
* Parry stamina refunds, movement speed and acceleration modifications, no stamina requirement for building, multipliers galore and more!

## Requirements
* [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)

## Installation
Install like any other BepInEx plugin, drop the dll into the BepInEx folder in the Valheim game directory. Configuration is done through the 7dd.dev.exhaustion.cfg file under BepInEx/config.

## Notes
Completely untested in multiplayer. If every client (and presumably the server) has the mod it might work, but I may not support issues with multiplayer.

Please report any issues on Github.
